        <h3>Here are 5 reasons you should be using a mood and activitiy tracker:</h3>
        <ol>
          <li> Triggers and warning signs. By using a mood diary you can monitor the patterns in your life and identify negative influences 
            (or “triggers”) that you need to avoid, and early warning signs that your health is deteriorating.</li>
          <li>Wellness strategies. A mood diary can help you to find the small things, as well as the big, that help you to stay well. It can
            show you the impact of the positive strategies that you adopt on your well-being.</li>
          <li>Planning for health.  It gives them a better understanding of their health and helps them to develop a plan for remaining well. 
            That is the key. The purpose of a mood diary should be to plan for wellness, not just keep a record of illness.</li>
          <li>Actively participate. In general people achieve better health outcomes when they educate themselves and are proactive about their health.</li>
          <li>A health professional’s dream. By keeping a mood diary you can provide your health professional with a precise, detailed history. 
            It removes the problem of memory recall and gives an accurate picture of what has been happening</li>
        </ol>
